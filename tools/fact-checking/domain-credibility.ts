 * Evaluates domain credibility using AI analysis on a scale of 1-10.

 * - Editorial standards and fact-checking processes
 * - Reputation in journalism and academia
 * - Transparency about sources and methodology
 * - Track record of accuracy and bias

 * console.log(score); // 10 (extremely credible)
 *
 * const score2 = await evaluateDomainCredibility("cnn.com");
 * console.log(score2); // 8 (very credible)
