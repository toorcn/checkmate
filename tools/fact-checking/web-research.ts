/**
 * Advanced web research and fact-checking tool using Exa API and OpenAI.
 *
 * This tool performs comprehensive fact-checking by:
 * 1. Generating optimized search queries using GPT
 * 2. Finding relevant sources via Exa Search API
 * 3. Retrieving full content using Exa Get Contents API
 * 4. Analyzing content with AI for verification
 * 5. Determining overall truthfulness and confidence
 *
 * **Claim Prioritization**: The tool distinguishes between PRIMARY claims (core facts)
 * and SECONDARY details (embellishments, superlatives). Verdicts are based on the
 * primary claim's accuracy. If the main fact is true but minor details are exaggerated
 * (e.g., "first country to do X"), the content is marked as "verified" with notes about
 * the inaccurate secondary details.
 *
 * @requires EXA_API_KEY environment variable
 * @requires AWS_REGION environment variable (for Bedrock)
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const result = await researchAndFactCheck.execute({
 *   transcription: "Vaccines cause autism in children",
 *   title: "Medical Claims Video",
 *   context: "Social media post with health claims"
 * });
 *
 * console.log(result.data.overallStatus); // "misleading"
 * console.log(result.data.confidence); // 0.9
 * console.log(result.data.sources.length); // 5
 * ```

2. **SOURCES SECTION**: Information about sources used (handled separately)
3. **ORIGIN TRACING SECTION**: Investigation of claim origins and propagation
4. **BELIEF DRIVERS SECTION**: Psychology behind why people believe this

Content to verify:
Title: ${title || "N/A"}
Transcription: ${transcription}
${context ? `Context: ${context}` : ""}

Credible sources found:
${searchContent}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - CLAIM PRIORITIZATION:**
When analyzing content, you MUST distinguish between:
1. **PRIMARY CLAIMS**: The main factual assertion being made (e.g., "Australia provides free education")
2. **SECONDARY DETAILS**: Embellishments, superlatives, or contextual details (e.g., "first country ever", "only nation to do this")

**Your verdict should be based primarily on the PRIMARY claim, NOT secondary details.**

If the PRIMARY claim is TRUE but SECONDARY details are false/exaggerated:
- Mark as "verified" if the core fact is accurate
- In your analysis, note which secondary details are inaccurate but emphasize that the main claim is true
- Do NOT mark content as "misleading" solely because of minor embellishments if the central fact is correct

Example:
- Content: "Australia provides free university education and is the first country ever to do so"
- PRIMARY CLAIM: Australia provides free university education
- SECONDARY DETAIL: "first country ever to do so"
- If Australia DOES provide free education but ISN'T the first: Mark as "verified" and note the secondary detail is inaccurate

Please provide a comprehensive fact-check analysis structured as follows:

**FOR THE DETAILED ANALYSIS SECTION (displayed first):**
1. **Identify the PRIMARY claim(s)** - What is the core factual assertion?
2. **Verify the PRIMARY claim(s) first** - Is the main fact true or false?
3. Overall verification status (verified/misleading/unverifiable) - Based PRIMARILY on the main claim
4. Evidence from the credible sources provided
5. Note any inaccurate SECONDARY details separately (but don't let them override the main verdict)
6. Reasoning behind your assessment
7. Any biases or credibility concerns
8. Comprehensive analysis of the evidence

**FOR THE ORIGIN TRACING SECTION (displayed after sources):**
If the content is false, misleading, or contains dubious claims, provide detailed:
- Likely origin of the claim (with earliest known appearances, links, or citations)
- How the claim evolved and spread across platforms
- Specific transformations of the narrative on different platforms
- Timeline of propagation if identifiable
- Key moments in the claim's evolution

**FOR THE BELIEF DRIVERS SECTION (displayed after origin tracing):**
Psychology/science-backed reasons why people might believe this content:
- Cognitive biases at play (e.g., confirmation bias, motivated reasoning)
- Narrative appeal and emotional triggers
- Social and cultural factors
- Academic references where possible

Format your response clearly with these sections:
- **Primary Claim Identification** (identify the core fact being asserted)
- **Primary Claim Verification** (verify the main claim with evidence)
- **Conclusion and Summary** (for Detailed Analysis section - based on primary claim)
- **Secondary Details Analysis** (note any inaccurate embellishments separately)
- **Evidence Analysis** (for Detailed Analysis section)
- **Source Credibility Assessment** (for Detailed Analysis section)
- **Reasoning and Methodology** (for Detailed Analysis section)
